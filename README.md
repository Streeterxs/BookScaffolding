# Book Scaffolding
This project today is a base structure to manage books, including creation, updates, fetching and deletes. Some of those request aren't working yet, but basically is that.

## Future
My plans is to create a base backend structure/database to create any product that I want which could have a relation with book. Examples: Book Sharing, Library, Book Consults, etc.
